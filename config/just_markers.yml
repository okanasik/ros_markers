# This file describes how markers are placed on objects.
#
# This can also be used to provide marker aliases, or transform the computed
# origin of a marker.
#
# This sample file define 3 objects, and covers the different options
# available.

# This first object has only one marker (ID 0). 'myobject1' is the name returned
# by the object detector. The size of the marker is 20x20 (the unit does not
# matter, but must be consistent with the calibration unit. We recommend to use
# millimeters).
# This simple declaration allows to define name aliases for markers. 'marker'
# and 'size' are the only two mandatory fields.
